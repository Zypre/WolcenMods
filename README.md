# Wolcen Mods

This is a place for my mods that I've made in Wolcen. This is still early days, and I may lose interest quickly, but there you go...

Because of the way that the file editing works, you can only have 1 mod active at the same time, which affects any given .pak file.
Most of the interesting stuff is in umbra.pak, which means you can realistically only have 1 active mod at a time.

##### Installation: 
Put the file inside the steamapps/common folder, or put the contents of the Wolcen folder inside the base game folder, then run the game.

##### Uninstallation: 
Delete the file and verify integrity of game files on Steam (or try to run the game after deleting. I think Steam fixes the game by itself)

## Descriptions:

### No Stash Cost MANY UNIQUES

Makes the stash tabs each cost 0 gold and causes all chests in story and adventure mode to drop far, far more uniques.
I have no idea if this is actually playable in a full playthrough, since you will pretty much only get uniques, but if you're on the hunt for something specific, or just want to try a weird way to play, go right ahead!

The chances of getting a unique item with this mod is about the same as getting a piece of armor in regular gameplay, and the chances of getting an Enneract is roughly the same chance as getting a weapon.

Regular items still drop, but they're about as rare as gems were before. Maybe rarer.
